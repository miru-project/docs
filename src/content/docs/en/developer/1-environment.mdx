To develop extensions for Miru, you only need to have the Miru [Windows](/en/download/) client installed. However, it is also possible to develop on the Android platform, although it may be challenging to debug without being able to view extension output logs.
It is recommended to use [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing.
